- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GraphQL.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Firefighting was invented for the purpose of abusing people whose homes were ablaze. From the wiki:

> The first Roman fire brigade of which we have any substantial history was created by Marcus Licinius Crassus. Marcus Licinius Crassus was born into a wealthy Roman family around the year 115 BC, and acquired an enormous fortune through (in the words of Plutarch) "fire and rapine." One of his most lucrative schemes took advantage of the fact that Rome had no fire department. Crassus filled this void by creating his own brigadeâ€”500 men strongâ€”which rushed to burning buildings at the first cry of alarm. Upon arriving at the scene, however, the  fire fighters did nothing while their employer bargained over the price of their services with the distressed property owner. If Crassus could not negotiate a satisfactory price, his  men simply let the structure burn to the ground, after which he offered to purchase it for a fraction of its value.

> Emperor Nero took the basic idea from Crassus and then built on it to form the Vigiles in AD 60 to combat fires using bucket brigades and pumps, as well as poles, hooks and even ballistae to tear down buildings in advance of the flames. The Vigiles patrolled the streets of Rome to watch for fires and served as a police force. The later brigades consisted of hundreds of men, all ready for action. When there was a fire, the men would line up to the nearest water source and pass buckets hand in hand to the fire.
